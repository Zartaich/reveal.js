# Intro 
(slide reactLogo) 
Hi, my name is Vadim, I'm a student at rolling scopes school, and today I am going  to  touch a little  a java script library called React. This presentation is not going to cover a lot of details.
Full documentation and introduction can be found on the official website.
The link will be in the description for this video.
Lets roll!!!

# What is react? 
(slide what is react?) 
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex user interfaces from small and isolated pieces of code called components.
This makes it easy to maintain, extend and share components throughout your application or even between applications.

# History 
(slide Jordan Walke photo) 
React.js  was started at Facebook by an engineer called Jordan Walke. You can see him on the photo.
Back in 2010 Facebook had issues with their rendering engine which was very slow processing DOM changes.
Furthermore the view code was not that modular and encapsulated which made it quite hard to maintain,
share and extend the codebase.
React.js was born to target those issues and implemented in the Newsfeed in 2011.
The Instagram engineers were also interested to use this new technology after Facebook acquired it in 2012.
The extraction of React.js from Facebooks codebase to be reusable in the Instagram code layed the foundation to make React.js open source in May 2013.

# Why react? 
(slide reactLove?) 
Now, the main question arises in front of us is why one should use ReactJS. There are so many open-source platforms for making the front-end web application development easier, like Angular. Let us take a quick look on the benefits of React over other competitive technologies or frameworks. With the front-end world changing on a daily basis, it’s hard to devote time to learning a new framework – especially when that framework could ultimately become a dead end. So, if you're looking for the next best thing but you're feeling a little bit lost in the framework jungle, I suggest checking out React.

# Simplicity 
(slide reactSimple) 
ReactJS is just simpler to grasp right away. The component-based approach, well-defined lifecycle, and use of just plain JavaScript make React very simple to learn, build a professional web (and mobile applications), and support it. React uses a special syntax called JSX which allows you to mix HTML with JavaScript. This is not a requirement; Developer can still write in plain JavaScript but JSX is much easier to use.

# Easy to learn 
(slide reactEasy) 
Anyone with a basic previous knowledge in programming can easily understand React while Angular and Ember are referred to as ‘Domain specific Language’, implying that it is difficult to learn them. For react you just need basic knowledge of CSS and HTML.

# Native Approach 
(slide reactNative) 
React can be used to create mobile applications (React Native). And React is a diehard fan of reusability, meaning extensive code reusability is supported. So at the same time we can make IOS, Android and Web application.

# Data Binding 
(slide reactBinding) 
React uses one-way data binding and an application architecture called Flux controls the flow of data to components through one control point – the dispatcher. It's easier to debug self-contained components of large ReactJS apps.

# Performance 
(slide reactPerfomance) 
React does not offer any concept of a built-in container for dependency. You can use Browserify, Require JS, EcmaScript 6 modules which we can use via Babel, ReactJS-di to inject dependencies automatically.

# Testability 
(slide reactTestability) 
ReactJS applications are super easy to test. React views can be treated as functions of the state, so we can manipulate with state we pass to the ReactJS view and take a look at the output and triggered actions, events, functions, etc.
Hope you have enjoyed this article. In the next article, we will disuss the differences between React JS and Angular, and will analyze which one is better and why. So, stay tuned for the next article.

# Conclusion 
(slide reactConclusion) 
React is a very new, but also established library to make reusable view components which are encapsulated, sharable and easy to maintain.
More and more companies are using it in their productive environments. The community is very active and extend React.js with new functionality on a daily basis.
It’s definitely worth it to learn and understand it because more and more React.js experts are needed to build user interfaces and help established companies
to transition from old fashioned technology to one of the hottest new view libraries currently available.
